## Scenario

<p>You work for Global Rain, a software engineering company that specializes in custom software design and development. As a junior software developer, you are part of a software development team that collaborates to create solutions for entrepreneurs, businesses, and government agencies worldwide.</p>

<p>As part of a development team at Global Rain, you will design and develop custom software for a local pet boarding and grooming business, Pet Boarding and Grooming (Pet BAG). Pet BAG wants to modernize its operations by introducing custom software that will help replace inefficient paper-based processes. Your Global Rain team will collaborate to develop an app with the following initial functional areas: pet check-in and pet check-out.</p>

<p>As part of this team, you have been tasked with completing some preliminary work. This work consists of writing a Java class, writing pseudocode, and creating a flowchart. You will provide these deliverables to your supervisor.</p>

## Directions

<p>Your supervisor has given you a specification document that details Pet BAG’s software needs and includes a UML class diagram. Using this document, you will create both a Java class and a summary report. Your summary report will include pseudocode, a flowchart for one method (pet check-in or pet check-out), and an explanation of how your work meets object-oriented principles (OOP).</p>

<ol>
    <li>Before you begin, you must understand what your client needs the software to do and what work your team has already done. Review the Pet BAG Specification Documentation in the Supporting Materials section, which includes a UML class diagram. Think about the real-world objects that you must represent in your code. These objects are your first-level blueprints. Pay close attention to the class hierarchy, attributes, and behaviors. Consider how these classes will interact with one another and what information must be passed between them.</li>
    <li>To begin, open the Virtual Lab by clicking the link in the Virtual Lab Access module. Then open your integrated development environment (IDE) and create the Pet class based on the specifications in the UML class diagram. The Pet class must include the following criteria:
    <ul>
        <li><b>All attributes with appropriate data structures (Note that the types are not specified in this UML class diagram. You must consider the most appropriate data type for each attribute.)</li></b>
        <li><b>At least one constructor method (You may use a default constructor. To score “exemplary” on this criterion, your constructor must initialize values for the petType, petName, petAge, dogSpaces, catSpaces, daysStay, and amountDue attributes.</li></b>
        <li><b>Accessors and mutators for all attributes</li></b>
    </ui>
</ol>
